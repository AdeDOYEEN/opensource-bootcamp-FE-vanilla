# GDSC Open source Frontend bootcamp - Vanila Js

We'd be building a Job listing web app with the integration of an api to fetch the listings and to authenticate the users.

We'd be using the following tools:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The /assets directory contains the preview of the web app in the /design sub-directory, icons to be used in the /icons sub-directory and the images to be used in the /images sub-directory .

## Happy Hacking
